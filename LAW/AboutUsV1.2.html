	<h1 class="topHead">The Live Action Spirit</h1>

	<p class="aboutIntro" id="firstParagraph">The Live Action Spirit is derived from our favorite television star and fellow Appalachian, Ernie Lee Brown, Jr., better-known as "The Turtle Man". The Turtle Man embodies the blue-collar, light-hearted spirit that has made LAW into what it is today. Live Action Woodworking <strong>(LAW)</strong> has been an official organization since 2014. Unofficially, though, we have over 100 years of combined woodworking experience and have been working together since bell-bottoms and discos were in style. When we moved into our shop in downtown Roanoke, <strong>"Not Responsible"</strong> was the phrase painted on the wall. We took it as a sign and liked it so much, we made it our official slogan. </p>

	<h2 class="mt-3 mb-2" id="operate">How We Operate</h2>

	<p class="aboutIntro" id="secondParagraph">We like to keep things local, whether it's our equipment, projects, lumber, or employees. Live Action only uses locally-harvested wood (primarily walnut) from a sawmill in Southwest Virginia. After building projects for companies such as Black Dog Salvage, we decided to create our own company. Today, we primarily serve local companies such as Oakey's funeral home and local churches in addition to creating custom furniture pieces for individuals in the area. We take pride in the fact that we hire hard-working individuals who may otherwise face barriers to employment. We believe that putting people to work, and more importantly- putting people to work in a positive, supportive work environment can and does create a positive change at both the individual and societal-level. </p>
